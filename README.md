This is a DBMS project named,"Capstone Management Portal" having SQL database and Flask based frontend. 
The Capstone Management System is a robust and user-centric web-based platform designed to efficiently manage capstone projects at PES University. 
Built using Flask, the system caters to three distinct user roles—students, faculty and administrators—offering tailored features and views for each.
Students can register projects, update progress, schedule appointments with mentors, upload multiple versions of reports and track their project evaluations, including ISA and ESA marks. 
Faculty members can review and manage assigned projects, monitor student progress, provide feedback, and evaluate panels in review panels. 
Administrators oversee system operations, including guide allocation, role assignments, and overall project data management.
